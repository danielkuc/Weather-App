# Project title and description
Weather application, data pulled from OpenWeatherMap Api with a simple and neat UI. Built as a project for "Modern javaScript from the beginning" course.
## Build status
Finished as far as I'm concerned, I've got a few ideas, mainly around building a better UI but not sure if I'll get around to doing it.
## Tech/framework used
Ui built with bootswatch including a modal. HTML and vanilla JS only(had to use a bit of Jqery for modal).
## How to use
click 'change location' input city name and country, and press save location. The app will save your last chosen loctation in local storage.
